<h1>A Story in My life</h1>
<p>An unimaginable, awe-inspiring part of my life began with myself being described as idle. My 10th board exam had ended with the beginning of holidays. Since it were the days of holidays and I was not going to any classes, my aunt connected me to ASK sir for internship for a short period. I went to ASK sir's office for the first time. I sat with my grandfather eagerly waiting to look at the person whom my aunt described about. I was called in to the room and sir talked to me and he told something which captured my heart. He told that, he will transform me from idle to an ideal boy. From that moment, I never wanted to miss any chance of learning about him. </p>

<p>From the next day, I came regularly to the office. I observed to know more about him. I was perplexed to know about the meditation and the 11:11 prayer which I had not seen anywhere once I had completed my infini-11. My life, which was a puzzle began to solve itself according to my knowledge. I started to admire him and without my knowledge, I began to follow his teachings. Many a people had told me to brush my teeth, and I will follow it but after a few days, I will forget that I had to brush. But when ASK sir told, I started brushing and it never ended even when I forgot a day or two.</p>

<p>. He introduced me to Mahatria. That was the first time I had ever heard of infinipath and my first time seeing Mahatria. Even though at first I could not understand most of the teachings in infinipath, I began to not just understand what Mahatria taught, but to love attending the path. I began to attend it week by week just to enjoy learning along with sir. I Have never ever seen ASK sir being really angry, but always happy celebrating the celebration called life. From then on, I too seldom got angry. I started to enjoy every food I ate, every place I went and every thing life gave. I started loving all the choice I got. I even got a lot of friends which I could still not believe. Even after my internship ended, I did not want my touch with ASK sir and infinitheism to get lost, so I began attending it every week.</p>

<p>
  Even though at first, my family said that I can't go there every week, I just did and now they mostly never deny. I started to love myself and I believe that I achieved a lot after meeting ASK sir. All these began last year with me being idle. I know that I did not completely become ideal and I know for a fact that I can never become ideal but what I do know for sure is that I will always move towards the destination of becoming ideal and thank you ASK sir for being the entry point and the path for it. You are my Guide, inspiration and motivation. Thank you so much. I am now excited to experience TAT (it is course) under the rays of his sunlight.
